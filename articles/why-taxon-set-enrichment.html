</h2>
<p>In human microbiome studies, a common goal is to compare microbial
profiles between groups. For example, treated vs untreated, disease vs
control, or timepoint 1 vs timepoint 2. We usually do this with
differential abundance (DA) analysis, which tests whether individual
bacteria differ between groups.</p>
<p>There are many DA methods, but they all share the same basic premise:
test microbes one by one.</p>
<p>Although this is standard practice, it raises a problem that is
rarely discussed. People rarely share the same exact microbial species.
Even in large cohorts, most taxa are low-prevalence. For example, in the
Human Microbiome Project, applying a modest 20% prevalence filter (a
species must appear in ≥20% of samples) removes the vast majority of
species from analysis.</p>
<p><img src="figures/HMP_data.png" alt="Challenges interpreting differences in human microbiome data" width="700"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. On the left, a heatmap of species-level profiles from
eight randomly selected participants in the Human Microbiome Project
shows that samples cluster almost perfectly by individual, highlighting
strong inter-individual variation. On the right, a histogram of common
commensal species prevalence demonstrates that many taxa are absent from
most samples, illustrating why species-level differential abundance is
often sparse and hard to reproduce.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, there is still no consensus on the “best” DA
method. In fact, method choice can dominate the biology: across 53 real
gut microbiome studies, several widely used DA tools produced
inconsistent results. That same benchmark suggests that much of what we
call DA signal is often prevalence-driven (zeros vs non-zeros) rather
than subtle abundance shifts <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/26/2/bbaf130/8093585" class="external-link">Pelto
et al., 2025</a></p>
<p>Much of the field has therefore focused on finding the optimal DA
method. But there is a more fundamental question we rarely ask: is
differential abundance the right question to begin with?</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible that a single microbe drives a phenotype.
But if one bacterium were responsible for complex diseases such as
inflammatory bowel disease, it would likely have been identified long
ago. Instead, what we observe in the overwhelming majority of human
microbiome studies is not the dominance of a single species, but
coordinated shifts across whole communities, patterns often described in
terms of diversity or dysbiosis.</p>
<p>The problem is that these concepts are usually not very actionable.
They are relative descriptions: there is no single “dysbiotic” or
“healthy” microbiome, and even diversity itself is a contextual measure
rather than a biological mechanism <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(23)00622-4/fulltext" class="external-link">O’Toole
et al., 2023</a> Recent large-scale meta-analyses reinforce this view,
showing that many so-called dysbiotic signatures reflect a shared,
non-specific response to disease with limited diagnostic or mechanistic
value <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01973-8" class="external-link">Duvallet et
al., 2017</a> (Duvallet et al., 2017; O’Toole et al., 2023).</p>
<p>In other ’omics fields, single-feature testing makes far more sense.
When comparing gene expression, epigenomes, or proteomes, samples
broadly share the same set of features, they differ in levels, not in
whether the features exist at all. In microbiome data, this assumption
breaks down completely: there are no universally shared species.</p>
<p>In short: traditional differential abundance asks us to compare
microbes one by one, but human microbiomes don’t work that way. Most
species are rare, poorly shared between people, and results depend
heavily on which method you choose. What we usually observe in real
studies is not single “causal” microbes, but broad, coordinated shifts
across communities: patterns that DA struggles to capture in a
consistent or biologically meaningful way.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea-behind-taxon-set-enrichment-analysis">The idea behind Taxon Set Enrichment Analysis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-idea-behind-taxon-set-enrichment-analysis"></a>
</h2>
<p>Taxon Set Enrichment Analysis starts from a simple observation: in
most human microbiome studies, biology is rarely driven by a single
species. What changes instead are groups of microbes that share a common
trait. Rather than asking “which individual bugs changed?”, TSEA asks a
more useful question: “are microbes with a shared biological property
shifting together?”</p>
<p>For example, are we seeing shifts in:</p>
<ul>
<li>facultative anaerobes?</li>
<li>taxa previously associated with inflammatory bowel disease?</li>
<li>butyrate producers?</li>
<li>mucin-utilisers?</li>
</ul>
<p>TaxSEA implements this idea as an R package by using curated
biological databases to define thousands of such groups, then applying a
rank-based enrichment test.</p>
<p>Under the hood, TaxSEA also handles a lot of practical complexity for
you such as harmonising taxon names across databases, converting
identifiers, and providing consistently formatted resources so different
knowledge bases can be used together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="but-isnt-this-what-functional-profiling-tools-e-g--humann3-do">But isn’t this what functional profiling tools (e.g. HUMAnN3)
do?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#but-isnt-this-what-functional-profiling-tools-e-g--humann3-do"></a>
</h2>
<p>Not really. Functional profiling tools work directly on gene families
and pathways. TaxSEA works on traits linked to taxa (species/strains)
based on prior knowledge and curated resources.</p>
<p>These approaches are related, but they are not the same. For example,
we may know a species can utilise mucin from in vitro work, even when
the precise genes or pathways responsible are unclear (or inconsistently
annotated). In that case, a trait-based grouping can capture biology
that pathway-based methods might miss.</p>
<p>Similarly, TaxSEA can tell you whether your data recapitulates a
microbial signature previously reported in another disease or context —
something functional tools are not designed to do.</p>
<p>TaxSEA is also lightweight: it only needs a species label plus a rank
(e.g. log2 fold change or correlation) and runs in seconds on a
laptop.</p>
<p>It is not meant to replace functional profiling, but to complement it
— providing biological context and prioritisation before you invest time
and resources in deeper functional analyses.</p>
