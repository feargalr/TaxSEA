Description: TaxSEA is an R package for Taxon Set Enrichment Analysis, which 
    utilises a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test analyses to 
    investigate differential abundance analysis output for whether there
    are alternations in a-priori defined sets of taxa from  
    public databases (BugSigDB, MiMeDB, GutMGene, mBodyMap, BacDive and
    GMRepoV2) and collated from the literature.  
    TaxSEA takes as input a list of taxonomic identifiers (e.g. species names, 
    NCBI IDs etc.) and a rank (E.g. fold change, correlation coefficient). 
    TaxSEA be applied to any microbiota taxonomic profiling technology 
    (array-based, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomics & 
    metatranscriptomics etc.) and enables researchers to rapidly contextualize 
    their findings within the broader literature to accelerate interpretation 
    of results.
