\usage{
ssTaxSEA(
  counts,
  lookup_missing = FALSE,
  min_set_size = 5,
  max_set_size = 300,
  custom_db = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A numeric matrix, data.frame, or
\code{SummarizedExperiment}/\code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} object.
For matrix/data.frame input: rows are taxa, columns are samples,
and row names must be taxon names (e.g. species names or NCBI IDs).
For SummarizedExperiment input: the first assay is used and
\code{rownames()} provide taxon identifiers.}

\item{lookup_missing}{Logical indicating whether to fetch missing
NCBI IDs via the NCBI API. Default is FALSE.}

\item{min_set_size}{Minimum size of taxon sets to include.
Default is 5.}

\item{max_set_size}{Maximum size of taxon sets to include.
Default is 300.}

\item{custom_db}{A user-provided list of taxon sets. If NULL
(default), the built-in TaxSEA database is used (excluding
BugSigDB).}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{scores}{A matrix (samples x taxon sets) of enrichment
      scores. Positive scores indicate the set taxa tend to have
      higher abundance in that sample relative to the cohort.}
    \item{pvalues}{A matrix (samples x taxon sets) of KS test
      p-values for each sample-set combination.}
  }
}
\description{
Computes per-sample enrichment scores for taxon sets using an
ssGSEA-style approach. Counts are CLR-transformed, then each
taxon is z-scored across samples to capture between-sample
variation. Per-sample enrichment is then computed by ranking
each sample's z-scores and applying a weighted running-sum
statistic against taxon sets from the TaxSEA database.
}
\details{
The approach works as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item Raw counts are CLR-transformed (centered log-ratio with
    pseudocount of 0.5 for zeros).
  \item Each taxon is then z-scored across all samples, so that
    values represent how much higher or lower a taxon is in a
    given sample relative to the cohort mean.
  \item For each sample, the z-scores are ranked and an
    ssGSEA-style weighted running-sum enrichment score is
    computed for each taxon set.
  \item A KS test p-value is also computed per sample per set.
}

This cohort-relative approach ensures that taxon sets which are
consistently elevated in a subset of samples (e.g. disease
samples) will produce high enrichment scores in those samples,
even if the taxa are not the most abundant within any single
sample.
