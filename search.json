TaxSEA also lightweight: needs species label plus rank (e.g. log2 fold change correlation) runs seconds laptop. meant replace functional profiling, complement — providing biological context prioritisation invest time resources deeper functional analyses.","code":""},{"path":"https://feargalr.github.io/TaxSEA/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Feargal Ryan.
